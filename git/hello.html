            <p>
                  In HTML, <h1> is a heading element, specifically the highest level of heading, often used for the main title or subject of a webpage
            </p>

            <p>
                  It's typically rendered with the largest text size and bold styling to visually emphasize the page's primary topic                  
            </p>
            
            <p>
                  While multiple <h1> tags are allowed by the HTML standard, it's generally best practice to use only one <h1> per page to represent the main title                  
            </p>
